            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                Greetings! I am AndrÃ©s Esteban Ruiz, a versatile Full Stack developer with a penchant for creating exceptional digital experiences. Throughout my career, I have honed my skills to encompass both front-end and back-end development, ensuring a smooth and engaging user journey.</p>
           <p>
                My journey began with a deep-rooted fascination for technology, and it has evolved into a professional dedication to crafting elegant solutions that marry design and functionality. From crafting eye-catching interfaces to architecting robust databases and optimizing server performance, I relish the challenge of mastering the entire software development lifecycle.</p>
           <!-- <p>
                On the front-end side, I love bringing designs to life, meticulously coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create beautiful and intuitive user interfaces. I have experience with frameworks such as ReactJS and Vue.js, which allow me to create dynamic and responsive applications that exceed expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the flip side, I revel in the complexities of back-end development. Leveraging technologies like Node.js and Python, I build the foundations on which applications operate. Scalability, security and efficiency are at the core of my back-end strategy, ensuring a robust infrastructure that can handle a wide range of tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it doesn't stop there. I am passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and trends, enabling me to adapt and thrive in an ever-evolving digital landscape. My drive to innovate and deliver exceptional results sets me apart in the fast-paced world of Full Stack Development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's embark on a journey of innovation together, where we can transform visions into tangible, high-performing solutions that leave a lasting impact.
            </p>-->
